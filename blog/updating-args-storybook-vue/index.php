        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Over the past few weeks I've been updating We Make Websites' internal framework with Storybook so we had a single place to see a projects' components in a sandboxed view.</p>

        <p>While doing this I found it particularly tricky to dynamically update the args passed to the Vue component from an event in the Vue component itself. The component in question was a quantity selector with buttons to increment and decrement a value displayed in its input.</p>

        <p>When I researched it there didn't seem to be a straightforward solution, the Storybook controls available to update the arg worked but I thought this wasn't the best way to simulate the different button states based on the quantity value.</p>

        <p>By piecing together various GitHub issues and forum posts I built the below solution. It's worth noting I'm not a Storybook expert so this could have some unforeseen consequence but it works in my testing with Vue 3.</p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>The solution revolves around the <code>updateArgs()</code> function available in the <code>useArgs()</code> function which is only available as a decorator. The trouble with it being a decorator is that you can't directly access it within a story so first we have to make it available.</p>

        <p>As noted in the <a href="https://storybook.js.org/docs/6/writing-stories/decorators#global-decorators">decorators documentation</a> you can use the <em>.storybook/preview.js</em> file to globally set decorators. Make sure any component-level decorators don't override it.</p>

        <code-block lang="js">
<textarea readonly>import { useArgs } from '@storybook/client-api'

export const decorators = [
  (story, context) => {
    const [_, updateArgs] = useArgs()
    return story({ ...context, updateArgs })
  },
]</textarea>
        </code-block>

        <p>The above export makes the <code>updateArgs()</code> function globally available. The <code>export</code> is an array which allows you to add further customisations such as globally setting the template:</p>

        <code-block lang="js">
<textarea readonly>export const decorators = [
  (story, context) => {
    const [_, updateArgs] = useArgs()
    return story({ ...context, updateArgs })
  },
  () => ({ template: '<story />' }),
]</textarea>
        </code-block>

        <p>Now in your story template you can access the <code>updateArgs()</code> function as below:</p>

        <code-block lang="js">
<textarea readonly>const Template = (args, { updateArgs }) => ({
  components: { QuantitySelector },
  setup() {
    return { args }
  },
  template: '<quantity-selector v-bind="args" @update-quantity="handleQuantityUpdate" />',
  methods: {
    handleQuantityUpdate(quantity) {
      updateArgs({ ...args, quantity })
    },
  },
})</textarea>
        </code-block>

        <p>The <quantity-selector> component already emits the update-quantity custom event when the buttons are clicked (see custom events documentation). This custom event is used in the template to trigger a custom method which uses the updateArgs function.</p>

        <p>Passing the existing args variable as a destructured object inside a new object with the new quantity variable is a shorthand way to update only the quantity variable's value. If you passed just the quantity variable then you would lose all your other args.</p>
