Personal website of principal developer Craig Baldwin working at BORN Group Shopify practice (originally We Make Websites).

## Tech stack

This site has been built from scratch with no build tool, I intentionally sought a minimal development experience using browser-native features. It has been developed using PHP, CSS, and web components.
