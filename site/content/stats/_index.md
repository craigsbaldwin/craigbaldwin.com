## [Distances](/stats/distances)

I like to keep track of as much data as possible using [Daytum](http://daytum.com/CraigBaldwin), Fitbit and a bit of manual calculation too.

## [Mountains](/stats/mountains)

I hope to climb all 214 of the fells described by [Wainwright](http://www.wainwright.org.uk/about_aw.html) one day, and I'm keeping track of my progress here.
