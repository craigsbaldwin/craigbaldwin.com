Working at We Make Websites I specialise in the front-end development of Shopify eCommerce stores as part of the leading Shopify Plus expert in the UK. Within six months I was made development lead of an internal team (pod) and put in charge of digital security and documentation. Since then I've led the development of, and launched, two technically challenging stores. Both went on to become ongoing retainer clients.

In the past with Intermedia, I've worked on projects for a diverse range of clients including B&Q, NATS, adidas, Network Rail, Madderson London, TK Maxx, and the Roald Dahl Museum. I've created websites, Shopify stores, books, magazines, brochures, posters, animations, and videos.

## Skills
I regularly work with HTML, SCSS, vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, APIs, Shopify Liquid, Bitbucket, DeployBot, Git, and Figma. I also have experience with GraphQL, Webpack, Sketch, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, InVision, Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, and datalayers. Our workflow includes Asana, GSuite, Slite, Teamweek, and VS Code.

## Responsibilities

As pod development lead I manage a small group of developers, providing them code review feedback and development guidance. I liaise with project managers to create briefs, provide estimates, and maintain client documentation. I also oversee We Make Websites' internal documentation and coding guidelines.

## Experience
Studied Graphic Design and Photography at the [Winchester School of Art](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/wsa/index.page) and graduated in 2010 with a 2:1. In 2017 started working at We Make Websites as a front-end developer. Previously worked for [Intermedia](https://intermediasolutions.com/), [RocketBase](http://rocketbase.co.uk/), and [ais London](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ais-london/).

## Personal
In my spare time I enjoy [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/craigbaldwin), swimming, and [walking](/mountains). I like to keep track of all my [stats](/stats). I'm most at home on the fells of the Lake District which I try to visit as often as possible. I hope to one day have climbed all 214 fells described by Alfred Wainwright.
