I've worked at [We Make Websites](https://wemakewebsites.com/) for over six years, specialising in the front-end development of Shopify e-commerce stores. I'm a principal developer, working on key client accounts as well as developing our internal framework and compiler. I've led the development and launch of nine projects and supported the development of over 50 more.

<!-- Childsplay Clothing, UFC Store, TP Toys, SofaSofa, This Works, Sons, Autonative (Ford), Underalls, Direct Doors -->

I enjoy technically challenging briefs which require complex logical problem solving and have a tendency towards perfectism in my code. My background in Graphic Design means I have an acute attention for detail and an eye for design.

## Skills
Regularly code in HTML, SCSS, vanilla JavaScript, Vue.js, and Shopify Liquid. Responsible for the development of our custom compiler built using Webpack, Node, Browsersync, and Shopify's Theme Kit with integrations for Figma tokens and Storybook.

Experienced using Bitbucket, Buddy, Git, GitHub, Figma, GraphQL, and data layers. The company workflow follows the agile methodology and includes the use of Google Workspace, Jira, Notion, Slack, and VS Code.

## Responsibilities

As a principal developer my responsibilities include company development standards, tools, and documentation with a shared responsibility for code quality, excellence of technical solutions, and helping to drive best-in-class development.

Day-to-day I lead the development of Canvas, our internal framework, and Basis, its Webpack-powered compiler. Both have been built from the ground up to provide the most performant stores and the best developer experience.

## Experience
Graduated with a BA (Hons) degree in Graphic Design and Photography from the [Winchester School of Art](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/wsa/index.page) in 2010. In 2017 started working at We Make Websites as a front-end developer. Previously worked for Intermedia Solutions for six years; a print and digital marketing agency.

## Personal
In my spare time I enjoy [running, swimming](https://www.strava.com/athletes/craigbaldwin), and [walking](/stats/mountains). I like to keep track of all my [stats](/stats/distances). I'm most at home on the fells of the Lake District which I try to visit as often as possible. I hope to one day have climbed [all 214 fells](/stats/mountains) described by Alfred Wainwright.
