Working at [We Make Websites](https://wemakewebsites.com/) for the past three years I specialise in the front-end development of Shopify eCommerce stores. Within six months of joining I was made development lead of an internal team (pod) and put in charge of digital security and documentation. I am now the development lead alongside the DevOps lead. I've led the development of, and launched, five stores and supported the ongoing development of many more.

I enjoy technically challenging briefs which require a degree of complex problem solving and have a tendency for perfectism in my code. My background in Graphic Design gives me an eye for design and I'm at my best when I have agency over the solution.

## Skills
Regularly developing in HTML, SCSS, vanilla JavaScript, Vue.js, Shopify Liquid, Bitbucket, DeployBot, Git, and Figma. Also have experience with integrating external APIs, GraphQL, Webpack, Sketch, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, InVision, Google Tag Manager, and data layers. The company workflow includes Asana, GSuite, Notion, Slack, and VS Code with a tech stack including yarn, npm modules, continuous integration and Cypress automated testing.

## Responsibilities

As development lead I'm responsible for company development standards, tools, and documentation with a shared responsibility for code quality, excellence of technical solutions and helping to drive best-in-class development.

As pod development lead I'm directly responsible for a small team of developers, providing code review feedback and developmental guidance ensuring continued code quality. I work with project managers to create briefs, solve technical hurdles, provide quotes, maintain client documentation, and write tech specs.

## Experience
Studied Graphic Design and Photography at the [Winchester School of Art](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/wsa/index.page), graduated in 2010 with a 2:1. In 2017 started working at We Make Websites as a front-end developer. Previously worked for [Intermedia](https://intermediasolutions.com/) for six years; a print and digital marketing agency.

## Personal
In my spare time I enjoy [running, swimming](https://www.strava.com/athletes/craigbaldwin), and [walking](/stats/mountains). I like to keep track of all my [stats](/stats/distances). I'm most at home on the fells of the Lake District which I try to visit as often as possible. I hope to one day have climbed all 214 fells described by Alfred Wainwright. I also enjoy photography and bouldering.
