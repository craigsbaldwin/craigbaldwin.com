Announcing the launch of my seventh project as lead developer. We took a phased approach for [tptoys.co.uk](https://www.tptoys.com/) to meet the tight deadlines so there's more to come with plenty of large features launching in a few months time including the product builder and tiered gift with purchase features.

I hope to post a write-up of how I achieved the two standout features soon; the seamless variant 3D model switching and making an easy to configure product builder.
