Originally brought in to help with an extremely tight turnaround, eventually taking on the role of project development lead, the store was ready to be delivered for the original deadline in under 50 worksdays.

Worked on headline features including product card with dynamic colour swatches, Nosto-powered product recommendations, product details and gallery page, Shopify Markets compatible multi-store switcher, Boost-powered product listing page and predictive search, size guide, and led right-to-left language support approach.

All built on the We Make Websites' framework and compiler that I built from scratch and is now used across all our projects.

Also helped project stay on budget by often completing tasks in under 50% of the original time estimate.
