When re-building this website I was faced with a problem when it came to the previous versions I used to host. Because everything is continuously deployed by Netlify from the repo it would have required loading all previous versions to the repo and for the sake of streamlining I decided against this.

Instead of looking back you can see my [latest work](/work) instead.
