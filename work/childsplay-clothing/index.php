        <p>Originally brought in to help with an extremely tight turnaround, eventually took on the role of project development lead. The store was ready to be delivered on time and built in under 50 working days from development start.

        <p>Worked on headline features including product card with dynamic colour swatches, Nosto-powered product recommendations, product details and gallery page, Shopify Markets compatible multi-store switcher, Boost-powered product listing page and predictive search, size guide, and determined approach for right-to-left language support.</p>

        <p>Also helped project stay on budget by often completing tasks in under 50% of the original estimate.</p>
